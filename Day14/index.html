    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Ricardo', 'Miguel', 'Carolina', 'Tomás'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
   const team2 = [].concat(players);
   team2[3] = 'Valentina';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
   const team3 = [...players];
   team3[3] = 'Sofía';

   // or use Array.from
   const team4 = Array.from(players);
   team4[3] = 'Carlos';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
   console.log(players, team2, team3, team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
   const person = {
       name: 'Ricardo',
       age: 32
   };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
   const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 40});
   console.log(person, person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
   // but for the time being, it doesn't work
   /* const person3 = {...person};*/

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

   // HOWEVER here's a poor man's deepClone, absolutely *not* recommended
